The virtual experience programme is provided by Tata iQ or Tata Insights and Quants. I discover how passionate, multidisciplinary experts utilise data visualisation technologies like Tableau and Power BI to take on some of the most difficult business problems and uncover fascinating insights buried in the mountains of produced data. 

The programme demonstrates the kind of issues dealt with by Tata Insights and Quants every day and makes an effort to imitate the difficulties an individual could have.

## **There are 4 modules in this virtual experience programme.**

- Framing the Business Scenario

- Choosing the Right Visuals

## Framing the Business Scenario

## Problem Statement :

**Background info and context**

An online retail store has hired you as a consultant to review its data and provide insights that would be valuable to the CEO and CMO of the business. The business has been performing well and the management wants to analyse what the major contributing factors are to the revenue so they can strategically plan for next year.

The leadership is interested in viewing the metrics from both an operations and marketing perspective. Management also intends to expand the business and is interested in seeking guidance into areas that are performing well so they can keep a clear focus on what’s working. They would also like to view different metrics based on the demographic information that is available in the data.

A meeting with the CEO and CMO has been scheduled for next month and you need to draft the relevant analytics and insights that would help evaluate the current business performance and suggest metrics that would enable them to make the decision on expansion.

Remember, thinking from the perspective of business leaders allows you to analyse the data more effectively and present better insights.

Access the links in the resources below to better understand how business leaders think and approach business performance.

**Details for task**

To prepare for your meeting, you need to draft questions that you think will be important and relevant to the CEO and CMO. This preparation will be your guide as you develop your presentation.

For this task, you are only required to draft the questions. Make sure to think both quantitatively and qualitatively.

You’ve been provided with a dataset in the resources below to use as the basis for your exploration. Review this data, taking note of what information has been provided, what insights you can garner, and what is relevant to both the CEO and CMO respectively.

Create a set of four questions that you anticipate each business leader will ask and want to know the answers to. Make sure you differentiate your questions, as both the CEO and CMO view business decisions through different lenses.

Eight (8) questions in total (4 for the CEO and 4 for the CMO)

## Questions Framed for CEOs and CMOs

### Concerns the CEO may have

### A country with the highest and lowest number of sales?

This question is important to the CEO as it is based on the fundamental source of income for the business, i.e., sales. Sales analysis is very important to the CEO as top-level executives are always focused on earnings and how to increase them. Here, the CEO is interested in viewing sales by country.

### What is the sales trend on a monthly basis?

A monthly trend of sales will provide the CEO with insights into how the sales are fluctuating each month. This will enable the CEO to analyse how the internal changes inside the company have had an impact on sales. E.g., how a new product launch has led to an increase in sales during the month or how the introduction of a new region has led to an increase in sales for the online store

### Is there any seasonal dependency on sales?

In retail businesses, there are always months that will have a greater demand due to seasonality. There will be cases where the data will experience regular and predictable changes that recur every calendar year. 

### Who is our most valuable customer?

Looking at the top customers of the retail store would provide an idea of which customers are contributing the most to the revenue.

### Concerns the CMO may have

### Most valuable product and least valuable product?

This question is important to the CMO as he will be working on product marketing for the product which is generated less revenue.

### Most selling and least selling product?

By this CMO will get Information about product sales(quantity), and will focus on products where marketing is needed.

### Monthly trends on product varieties?

Here CMO wants to know the trends of the sales of each product so that he can focus on the product sales on the basis of the month and market it accordingly.

### How many customers make the same purchases again and over again?

The CMO's interest in observing the patterns in customer orders is evident from this query.
The CMO is curious about the percentage of overall consumers that place repeat orders with them.
The CMO will better understand the proportion of repeat consumers with the aid of this data.

### Which consumers have placed many orders and how much revenue is generated by them?

How much a consumer spends at the store to buy goods determines the revenue for the business.
Because of this, analysis must be performed to ascertain how much money is coming from the store's frequent consumers.

## Communicating Insights and Analysis

### Revenue per month (Line Chart)

My analysis shows that there are some months of the year when exceptional growth is witnessed. The data shows that the revenue in the first 8 months is fairly constant as the average revenue generated for these 8 months is around $685k. The increase in revenue starts in the month of September when the revenue increases by 40% over the previous month. This trend continues till the month of November when it reached 1.5 million USD, the highest during the entire year.

### Top 10 Country - Revenue vs Quantity sold (Bar Chart)

The second visual shows how the top 10 countries which have opportunities for growth are performing. This data does not include the UK as the country already has high demand and I’ve been told you’re more focused on the countries where demand can be increased. The analysis shows that countries such as the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany and France have high volumes of units bought and revenue generated.

### Top 10 Valuable Customers (Bar Chart)

The third analysis has been performed on the top 10 customers who have purchased the most from the store. The data shows that there is not much of a difference between the purchases made by the top 10 customers. The highest revenue-generating customer only purchased 17% more than the 2nd highest which shows that the business is not relying only on a few customers to generate the revenue. This shows that the bargaining power of customers is low and the business is in a good position.
